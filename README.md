Final code for Mock Pick-and-Place Warehouse Robot for Unified Robotics I: Actuation (RBE 2001)

- Working with 3 teammates, this robot was designed and programmed in order to move via teleoperation and grab objects using a 2 degree-of-freedom translational parallel maipulator
- For the arm's motion, we programmed in the inverse kinematics that return the correct servo angles to deliver the endeffector to the desired position given to the robot via a remote controller
- I personally focused on wiring the electrical components on the robot, such as the motor driver, and worked on most of the programming
- By mapping keyboard keys to different motions, we were able to operate the robot and get it to transfer items between small 3D-printed shelves like a real warehouse robot would
